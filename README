munin_weather
=============

These are just a few code snippets that try to glue weather stations and
other sensor devices (1-wire, arduino, etc.) to Munin for visualization.
See also: http://munin-monitoring.org/ for details about measuring with munin.

muninexchange/:
Sensor reading code from http://muninexchange.projects.linpro.no/?search

ws2300/:
I'm using a modified version of "Open2300" v.1.10 to get sensor readings
from a Conrad WS2300 weather station (RS232 connection).

te923/:
I'm using a modified version of "te923con" v.0.4 to get sensor readings
from a Mebus TE821 weather station (USB connection).

onewire/:
I'm using an unmodified version of "DigiTemp" v.3.6.0 to get sensor readings
from serially connected One-Wire sensors: DS1820, DS18B20.
See also: http://www.digitemp.com/software.shtml
I'm using a homegrown RS232 adapter (compatible to DS9097).
Munin 1.4.x also comes with a standard plugin called "digitmep_".

etc/:
munin.conf: make aggregate weather graphs from basic measurements

arduino/:
Arduino-Stuff goes here: to be done

avrnetio/:
Use Pollin AVR-NET-IO boards for sensor readings: to be done
